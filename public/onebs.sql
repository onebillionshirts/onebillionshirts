Annually, more than 800 children and their families benefit from programs and services at our five campus locations: Boston, Jacksonville, New York City, Northampton and Philadelphia. Clarke impacts the lives of children and adults through educational and early childhood programs, hearing services, mainstream services, research, curriculum development and the teachers and professionals trained by Clarke who take their special skills to all parts of the world.</p>','<p>Formerly Clarke School for the Deaf / Center for Oral Education, in 2010, we changed our name to Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech. This change reflects our distinct mission of teaching children who are deaf and hard of hearing how to listen and talk using the latest technology; and it also highlights our multiple locations - which continue to grow! Our new logo is a vibrant mark celebrating the growth and success of Clarke children. Each day, we watch and listen as they blossom - gaining confidence and acquiring the ability to reach their full potential. As Clarke reaches more children than ever before, our mission remains unchanged: Providing children who are deaf and hard of hearing with the listening, learning and spoken language skills they need to succeed. Today, the possibilities for children who are deaf and hard of hearing are greater than ever before. We work with families and professionals to ensure that every child has the chance to reach their full potential.<br /><br /> Our History<br /><br /> Clarke was founded in 1867 in Northampton by Gardiner Green Hubbard, whose four-year-old daughter, Mabel, became deaf from scarlet fever. Firmly believing his daughter could speak and learn just like other children, Hubbard hired a teacher to work with Mabel on her speech and language. At age 10, Mabel did as well in the classroom as any of her hearing peers.<br /><br /> With the help of philanthropist John Clarke, Hubbard started Clarke School to help other deaf children learn to listen, speak, and succeed. A trailblazing organization from the very beginning, Clarke became the first school in the country to teach deaf students using the oral method and the first to recognize the importance of successfully mainstreaming deaf students into their neighborhood schools. Through our partnership with Smith College, Clarke was also the first to train teachers in auditory/oral education.<br /><br /> Over the last two decades, universal newborn hearing screening and advanced technology like cochlear implants have made it possible for deaf and hard of hearing children to learn to listen and talk at earlier ages than ever before. In response to a growing need for auditory/oral services for young children, Clarke opened four additional campuses: Boston (1995), Jacksonville (1996), New York (1999) and Philadelphia (2001).<br /><br /> Clarke continues to evolve to meet the needs of children with hearing loss and their families through new initiatives like our expanded mainstream services. Despite the many changes Clarke has seen since its founding, our mission of teaching children to listen, talk and thrive has always remained constant.<br /><br /> Our Philosophy<br /><br /> Clarke is a listening and spoken language program, which means that we teach children to listen and speak, rather than use sign language. At Clarke, children use cochlear implants and hearing aids to maximize their access to sound, and our specially trained teachers, audiologists and speech language pathologists help them develop listening, literacy and spoken language skills to maximize their learning. Our goal is to prepare children to succeed in mainstream classrooms alongside their hearing peers. Because of increased newborn hearing screenings and early intervention services, many children who come to Clarke are ready tomainstream as early as kindergarten.<br /><br /> There are many different schools of thought about educating children who are deaf and hard of hearing. At Clarke, we recognize that there is no single approach that is right for every child. We provide parents with the tools they need to understand their child&rsquo;s hearing loss, make informed choices about educational options and find the path that is right for their family.<br /><br /> More Than a School<br /><br /> In addition to our school programs, Clarke also offers Birth to 3 services, Summer Programs , Mainstream Services, Educational Evaluations and Professional Training opportunities. We also offer hearing services for adults on our Northampton and Philadelphia campuses.<br /><br /></p>','http://youtu.be/_IpddxXJCXg',3,0,0,'@clarkeschools','http://www.facebook.com/clarkeschools','2013-03-12 15:10:50','2013-04-02 12:54:25',0,'clarke-schools-for-hearing-and-speech'),(3,'Buzzards Bay Coalition','620 Belleville Avenue','New Bedford','MA',2745,'http://www.savebuzzardsbay.org/','04-2971978','<p>The Buzzards Bay Coalition is a membership-supported non profit organization dedicated to the restoration, protection and sustainable use and enjoyment of our irreplaceable Bay and its watershed. The Bay Coalition works to improve the health of the Bay ecosystem for all through education, conservation, research and advocacy.</p>\r\n<div id=\"landing-columns\">&nbsp;</div>','<p>Since 1987, a&nbsp;Coalition&nbsp;of community members has worked tirelessly to support&nbsp; the restoration, protection, and sustainable use of Buzzards Bay and its watershed. The organization\'s remarkable history supports our work today and into the future.</p>\r\n<div id=\"content-columns\">\r\n<p>The Buzzards Bay Coalition was officially incorporated&nbsp;as&nbsp;The Coalition for Buzzards Bay&nbsp;in July 1987, as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization with start-up funding support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The initial Board of Directors was composed of individuals from throughout the Bay watershed - environmental advocates, cranberry growers, marina owners, research institutions and town government. Today, the organization continues to maintain a governing Board of private citizens concerned with the health and future of the Bay from Westport to Woods Hole and from a variety of backgrounds.</p>\r\n<p>The push to reverse the decline of Bay water quality, shellfish beds, and wildlife populations had begun in earnest in 1984 when Congress recognized the unique value of Buzzards Bay by selecting the Bay as one of four estuaries in the country (Buzzards Bay in Massachusetts, Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, San Francisco Bay in California, and Puget Sound in Washington) to be studied under the new National Estuary Program. With this program, a new government partnership between the EPA and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEA) was formed to create the Buzzards Bay Project (BBP). The objective of the BBP was to study water quality and living resources in the Bay, to assess threats to Bay health, and to develop a long-term management plan for the Bay. Toward that end, the Buzzards Bay Project completed a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for the Bay in 1991.</p>\r\n<p>Directing the activities of the BBP during its early years was a Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) comprised of local town officials, environmental advocates, and members of the scientific community. This group was charged among other things with determining if Buzzards Bay would benefit from the establishment of a private advocate/watchdog group to ensure that the right decisions were being made for the Bay long after the Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program was dissolved. In order to make that decision, the first Buzzards Bay Day was held on October 11, 1986 with varying events held around the Bay watershed - tours of Buttermilk Bay, the Elizabeth Islands, and the Pocasset River as well as clean-up projects in New Bedford and elsewhere. Ninety-nine percent of the general public that came out for this first-of-its-kind regional event responded to a questionnaire that they felt that a permanent advocacy group was needed for Buzzards Bay. The Coalition for Buzzards Bay was formed less than a year later.</p>\r\n<div id=\"column1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>','http://youtu.be/1kbSkksgetY',4,0,0,'@SaveBuzzardsBay','https://www.facebook.com/savebuzzardsbay','2013-03-12 15:17:05','2013-03-21 17:25:46',NULL,'buzzards-bay-coalition'),(4,'Combined Jewish Philanthropies','126 High Street','Boston','MA',2110,'http://www.cjp.org/','04-2103559','<p>CJP, Greater Boston\'s Jewish Federation, brings together the people, partners and resources to fulfill the most important needs and aspirations of our community.

Since our founding, we have helped over 290,000 Massachusetts children with packages of goods that are hand-picked by caring volunteers to meet a child\'s specific needs.</p>','<p>The Cradles to Crayons story began in December 2000, during the Christmas vacation, when&nbsp;Lynn Margherio&mdash;a Boston-based business and public-policy consultant who had recently spent several years in Washington working with the Clinton administration&mdash;was visiting the homes of her brother and sister in Michigan.</p>\r\n<p>One morning, she was helping a young niece get dressed. As she dug through a dresser drawer to find just the right outfit, she saw some tops and bottoms with price tags still on them. There was the never-worn green top&mdash;destined to remain folded forever in the drawer because it wasn\'t pink&mdash;and a pair of size 2T pants that reflected her niece\'s fashion sense (pink), but already were a size too small.</p>\r\n<p>Later on that same trip, she stopped at her brother\'s house, where she got involved with an arts-and-crafts project with another niece and nephew in their play room. But to get to get to the table with the glitter, stickers and markers, she had to step over piles of toy trucks, puzzles, and games, and navigate around a plastic kitchen set, an air hockey table, and a train table. (&ldquo;It looks like our own personal Toys R Us,&rdquo; she said to herself.) She also noted that despite the profusion of stuff, her niece and nephew tended to gravitate toward one or two favorite toys. The rest were more or less ignored. Later, she saw several unopened presents wind up on the top shelf of a closet.</p>\r\n<p>An idea came to her: What if all of these like-new or never-used children\'s things could find their way into the homes of other boys and girls&mdash;kids who really needed them?</p>\r\n<h3>Making it happen in Boston</h3>\r\n<p>Back home in Boston, she began taking steps to make that happen. She visited shelters and health centers, asking if they had the resources to help families meet basic needs like clothing. Consistently, the answer was no. Next, she started calling schools and community groups to see if they would be willing collect children\'s goods. The reaction was almost uniformly positive. So Margherio commandeered some extra office space at the consulting firm where she was a partner, lined the space with shelving and plastic bins from Home Depot, and started going from school to school in a rented truck to collect other people\'s stuff.</p>\r\n<p>This ad hoc system, mostly invented in real time, slowly gained momentum, and&mdash;in 2002&mdash;was formally launched as Cradles to Crayons.</p>\r\n<p>A highlight in our recent history came in 2005, when former President Bill Clinton visited the Boston warehouse.

It has since worked with indigenous communities in Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Australia, becoming the leading US-based organization defending the rights of indigenous peoples around the world. Our efforts are guided by a board of directors that includes some of the world\'s preeminent indigenous leaders, as well as anthropologists, philanthropists, and entrepreneurs, and our executive director is a renowned human rights lawyer. Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Cultural Survival also has a satellite office for our Guatemala Radio Project in Guatemala.</p>','<p>The impulse for the founding of Cultural Survival arose during the 1960s with the &ldquo;opening up&rdquo; of the Amazonian regions of South America and other remote regions elsewhere. As governments all over the world sought to extract resources from areas that had never before been developed, the drastic effects this trend had on the regions\' Indigenous Peoples underscored the urgent need to partner with Indigenous communities to defend their human rights. Cultural Survival was founded to help Indigenous Peoples in their struggles for human rights, sovereignty, and autonomy.<br /><br /> Throughout the 1970s, Cultural Survival&rsquo;s original founders David Maybury-Lewis (pictured right with Xavante elder Sibupa), Evon Vogt, Jr., Orlando Patterson, and Pia Maybury-Lewis functioned out of a space made available by Harvard&rsquo;s Peabody Museum. The organization was incorporated in 1972 as a tax-exempt NGO in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Since its inception, Cultural Survival has been at the forefront of the international Indigenous rights movement. Cultural Survival&rsquo;s work has contributed to a revolution of empowerment for Indigenous Peoples around the world. In the first years Cultural Survival launched a publication program consisting of the Cultural Survival Newsletter and a series of Special Reports which eventually became the Cultural Survival Quarterly. Cultural Survival also introduced its annual bazaars, which display and sell Indigenous arts and crafts.<br /><br /> n the 1980s and 1990s, Cultural Survival created an economic strategy in order to bargain with governments who were ready to clear cut rainforests. Cultural Survival Enterprises (CSE) became a non-profit trading division that developed and marketed products generating income for Indigenous people who were struggling to protect their lands and traditions within rainforest regions. Cultural Survival Enterprises, spearheading the Fair Trade movement, was launched to help Indigenous groups receive a greater profit from their sold goods, however, after considerable debate among the board and staff and due to complications with the supply, it was decided to no longer support this program.<br /><br /> Ellen L. Lutz became director of Cultural Survival in 2004 and transformed the organization over the next six years, strongly emphasizing human rights and advocacy areas in which she had an international reputation. For 25 years, Cultural Survival labored with many Indigenous activitst to win United Nations adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Ellen played a key role in helping shepherd this long process and on September 13, 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted a visionary text that set the global standard for how governments must treat Indigenous Peoples. <br /><br /> An offshoot of these efforts, Cultural Survival started partnering with Guatemalan nongovernmental organizations to create a thriving network of over 200 community radio stations across Guatemala, many of which broadcast in one or more of the country&rsquo;s 23 indigenous languages. The stations offer news, educational programming, human rights and health information, and traditional music, all reinforcing pride in Mayan heritage.<br /><br /> In 2007, Cultural Survival turned its attention on the much-needed revitalization of critically endangered Native American languages. Cultural Survival partnered with tribal governments, foundations, corporations, and businesses to persuade the United States Congress to fund legislation providing federal support for language immersion programs.<br /><br /> In 2009, Ellen oversaw the merger of Cultural Survival and Global Response. Global Response, a nongovernmental organization, directed campaigns to protect Indigenous rights all around the world. Global Response has developed relationships with Indigenous communities in order to help them stop government abuse and exploitation of their lands and natural resources.<br /><br /> Suzanne Benally (Navajo and Santa Clara Tewa from New Mexico) is the current executive director. Suzanne was the associate provost for institutional planning and assessment and associate vice president for academic affairs at Naropa University. She was a core faculty member in environmental studies and a member of the president&rsquo;s cabinet. <br /><br /> Under Suzanne&rsquo;s direction, Cultural Survival is set to reflect a robust and inclusive role. &ldquo;It is our goal to become a world leader in advocacy for Indigenous Peoples rights to their land, languages and cultures,&rdquo; Suzanne says. &ldquo;We fully intend to continue our efforts in creating a world in which Indigenous Peoples speak their languages, live on their lands, control their resources, hold on to their culture, and whose rights are honored in participating in broader society.

We can then use this genetic information to reliably predict, early in life, those at greatest risk for the disease (with legal safeguards and genetic and psychological counseling). Our foundational research projects include: Alzheimer\'s Genome Project, Alzheimer\'s Genome Map, Alzheimer\'s Brain-Genetic Study, Alzheimer\'s Clinical-Genetic Study, Alzheimer\'s Gene Database, MicroRNA\'s and APP, and Alzheimer\'s Gene Discovery Project.</p>','<p>In late 2004, three families&mdash;the McCances, the Morbys and the Rappaports&mdash;came together to inject new life into finding a cure for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.<br /><br /> They were all frustrated with the pace of research. The drug pipeline was coming up dry. Research funding was risk averse and slow to respond to new discoveries. Even the most prominent Alzheimer&rsquo;s scientists were spending a third of their time filling out lengthy grant applications. Meanwhile, both the prevalence and costs of Alzheimer&rsquo;s were skyrocketing. Already, the disease afflicts 5 million Americans and costs $180 billion each year in the United States alone; those figures will nearly triple by 2050.<br /><br /> Leveraging their experience in venture capital and corporate start-ups, Henry McCance, Phyllis Rappaport, and Jacqui and Jeff Morby built a new venture-based Alzheimer&rsquo;s research fund designed to dramatically accelerate research, make bold bets and focus deeply on finding a cure.<br /><br /> In just seven years, with just $20 million spent, Cure Alzheimer&rsquo;s Fund has an unparalleled track record. Its Alzheimer&rsquo;s Genome Project (AGP)TM was the largest single disease scan of all time and was considered one of the &ldquo;Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs in the world in 2008&rdquo; by Time and CNN. Its funded research work has also been noted by The Wall Street Journal, NPR and the White House. And one of its star researchers, Steve Wagner from the University of California, San Diego, has just been chosen for a pilot project for the prestigious new &ldquo;Blueprint&rdquo; drug discovery program at the National Institutes of Health.<br /><br /> Cure Alzheimer&rsquo;s Fund focuses the best scientific minds in the industry. It does so scrupulously, and without any financial gain for its founders, donors or researchers. And since the founders cover all administrative costs, every dollar donated is guaranteed to go straight to funding new research.<br /><br /> The Plan. The goal of CAF is to stop the disease before it even strikes, with early prediction and prevention. Discovered more than 100 years ago, Alzheimer&rsquo;s is a genetic disease. But up until 2005, researchers only had discovered four genes associated with the disease, which accounted for just 30 percent of the inherited risk. Since 2005, CAF has discovered 120 other genes that are linked with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and make up the other 70 percent of those at risk. But more importantly, identifying these genes is the first step to understanding the cause of the disease before a cure can be found. Research is the only path to progress.<br /><br /> For the past five years, CAF has focused some of the best scientific minds in the industry on fighting this disease. Our researchers are focused on cutting-edge work that is making progress in the search for a cure. They are tackling the biggest issues in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease at renowned institutions across the United States and abroad.<br /><br /> Despite the organization&rsquo;s own VC roots, Cure Alzheimer&rsquo;s Fund is a non-profit organization. We embrace the VC strategy solely to find a cure for Alzheimer&rsquo;s, not to create financial gain for our founders, investors or researchers.

Both children and adults with autism typically show difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. One should keep in mind however, that autism is a spectrum disorder and it affects each individual differently and at varying degrees - this is why early diagnosis is so crucial. By learning the signs, a child can begin benefiting from one of the many specialized intervention programs.<br /><br /> Prevalence of Autism<br /><br /> In March 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued their ADDM autism prevalence report. The report concluded that the prevalence of autism had risen to 1 in every 88 births in the United States and almost 1 in 54 boys. The spotlight shown on autism as a result of the prevalence increase opens opportunities for the nation to consider how to serve these families facing a lifetime of supports for their children.<br /><br /> Currently, the Autism Society estimates that the lifetime cost of caring for a child with autism ranges from $3.5 million to $5 million, and that the United States is facing almost $90 billion annually in costs for autism (this figure includes research, insurance costs and non-covered expenses, Medicaid waivers for autism, educational spending, housing, transportation, employment, in addition to related therapeutic services and caregiver costs).<br /><br /> Autism knows no racial, ethnic, social boundaries, family income, lifestyle, or educational levels and can affect any family, and any child.<br /><br /> And although the overall incidence of autism is consistent around the globe, it is four times more prevalent in boys than in girls.<br /><br /></p>','',8,1,1,'@flutiefdn','https://www.facebook.com/flutiefoundation?sid=310041f7b87d6b2603ea1b5ff11f2575&ref=s','2013-03-12 15:51:47','2013-04-01 16:33:03',0,'doug-flutie-jr-foundation-for-autism'),(18,'Earthwatch Institute','114 Western Ave','Boston','MA',2134,'http://www.earthwatch.org/','23-7168440','<p>Earthwatch Institute is an international organization that brings science to life for people concerned about the Earth\'s future.

Farm Aid fosters connections between farmers and eaters by growing and strengthening local and regional markets and working to get family farm food in urban neighborhoods, grocery stores, restaurants, schools and other public institutions.<br /><br /> Helping Farmers Thrive<br /><br /> For over 27 years, Farm Aid has answered 1-800-FARM-AID to provide immediate and effective support services to farm families in crisis. Now Farm Aid\'s online Farmer Resource Network connects farmers to an extensive network of organizations across the country that help farmers find the resources they need to access new markets, transition to more sustainable and profitable farming practices, and survive natural disasters.<br /><br /> Taking Action to Change the System<br /><br /> Farm Aid works with local, regional and national organizations to promote fair farm policies and grassroots organizing campaigns designed to defend and bolster family farm-centered agriculture. We\'ve worked side-by-side with farmers to protest factory farms and inform farmers and eaters about issues like genetically modified food and growth hormones. By strengthening the voices of family farmers, Farm Aid stands up for the most resourceful, heroic Americans&mdash;the family farmers who work the land. Farm Aid\'s Action Center allows concerned citizens to become advocates for farm policy change.</p>','http://youtu.be/e7sGdCVOyCQ',1,0,0,'@FarmAid','http://www.facebook.com/FarmAid','2013-03-12 16:14:17','2013-03-21 17:25:46',NULL,'farm-aid'),(25,'The Food Bank of Western Massachusetts','97 North Hatfield Road','Hatfield','MA',1038,'http://www.foodbankwma.org/','04-2751023','<p>The mission of The Food Bank of Western Massachusetts is to work with our community to reduce hunger and increase food security.

Ouimet had grown up in a modest home across the street from the 17th hole at TCC, and was self-taught, learning to play in his backyard.<br /><br /> Prior to his victory, golf was dominated by the British and Scots. There were very few players in America, virtually no public courses, and the game was confined mostly to the wealthy or elite. Ouimet&rsquo;s victory changed all of that. His victory and unlikely background combined to create an inspirational moment. Within ten years the number of American players had tripled and many new courses were built, including public courses.<br /><br /> Another great moment in golf occurred just before the start of the Open playoff. Francis Ouimet turned down the offer of an experienced TCC member who wished to caddie for him, deciding instead to stay with ten-year-old Eddie Lowery. The photo of Ouimet and Lowery marching down the fairway together is one of the most famous in golf history, and symbolizes Ouimet&rsquo;s great victory and kindness to a young person. As one of golf&rsquo;s most enduring images, it was selected by the United States Golf Association as the logo for its own Centennial celebration.<br /><br /> Ouimet went on to a distinguished amateur golf career. He won the U.S. Amateur in 1914 and 1931. He also played on the first eight Walker Cup Teams and was Captain of the next four, compiling an 11-1 team record. Revered as a golfing goodwill ambassador, he became the first American elected Captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in 1951.<br /><br /> Francis Ouimet is one of the most honored players in history. He has been named to every golf Hall of Fame, has a room named after him in the USGA Museum, and he is also one of only four golfers to have a U.S. Commemorative stamp issued in his name. The 1963 and 1988 U.S. Opens at The Country Club celebrated the 50th and 75th anniversaries of his dramatic U.S. Open win. The U.S. Senior Open Trophy is also named after him, as are several others around the country. More recently, the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund began a Francis Ouimet Award for Lifelong Contributions to Golf.</p>','http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utAVoch3pQI&feature=share&list=UURIG84GxtANBFz5XhDhslvQ',1,0,0,'@ouimetfund','http://www.facebook.com/OuimetScholarship','2013-03-12 16:29:17','2013-03-21 17:25:47',NULL,'francis-ouimet-scholarship-fund'),(28,'FRAXA Research Foundation','45 Pleasant Street','Newburyport','MA',1950,'http://www.fraxa.org/','04-3222167','<p>FRAXA\'s mission is to accelerate progress toward effective treatments and ultimately a cure for Fragile X, by directly funding the most promising research.</p>','<p>FRAXA Research Foundation was founded in 1994 by three parents of children with Fragile X syndrome, Katie Clapp, Michael Tranfaglia, MD, and Kathy May, to support scientific research aimed at finding a treatment and a cure for Fragile X syndrome.

Most of these services are not covered by insurance or third party payers, and they are very costly. To cover these costs The Genesis Fund raises money through special events, corporate giving, and personal donations.</p>\r\n<p>The first major event held to benefit The Genesis Fund was an evening with legendary dancer, Rudolph Nureyev. A concert by the great tenor Luciano Pavarotti soon followed and later, an unforgettable Gala at Filenes.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, The John Havlicek Celebrity Fishing Tournament, Welch&rsquo;s/Yaz Legends Golf Tournament, the KISS108 concert, and the Children&rsquo;s Miracle Network Telethon were added to our impressive roster of benefit events.</p>\r\n<p>That was just the beginning. Today there are many wonderful events raising money for The Genesis Fund. See our&nbsp;Events&nbsp;page for details.</p>\r\n<p>The success of The Genesis Fund can be credited in large part to the invaluable efforts of our Board of Directors. Initially, the board members were from the local media, and now corporate executives and sports legends have joined this illustrious group of dedicated individuals.</p>\r\n<p>As The Genesis Fund&rsquo;s event calendar has expanded over the years, more and more programs to help these children and their families have evolved as well.</p>\r\n<p>The Feingold Center for Children&nbsp;innovated a system for coordinating multiple appointments so that the patients are seen by more than one specialist at the same visit.

Through this story we promote appreciation of the aesthetics, beliefs, achievements and controversies that have defined the Shaker experience in America.</p>','<p>Our vision is &ldquo;to become a center for reflection on leading a principled life.&nbsp; The values that the Shakers embraced &ndash; equality, pacifism, community, sustainability, responsible land stewardship, innovation, simplicity, and quality in work &ndash; resonate for us today.&nbsp; Our programs and business practices reflect these values. We utilize our site and our collections to help the public engage with contemporary thinking on these values while learning about historical Shaker expressions of these principles in their work, worship and community.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Shakers are a religious order which believed in pacifism, celibacy, and communal living. Worship could take the form of singing and ecstatic dance, which is why they were called the &ldquo;Shaking Quakers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shakers.&rdquo; The utopian sect is renowned today for its plain architecture and furniture.</p>\r\n<p>In 1774, Mother Ann Lee led eight Shaker converts from Manchester, England, to America, seeking freedom to live, work, and worship. The Shakers believed in racial and gender equality, simplicity, and pacifism. One of the most intriguing religious movements in American history, the Shakers are considered by many to be the most successful of utopian societies that have flourished in this country. The Shakers have made important contributions to American culture including art, architecture, craftsmanship, music, government, agriculture, and commerce. Hancock Shaker Village, a National Historic Landmark, brings the Shaker story to life and preserves it for future generations. Visit Hancock Shaker Village and be inspired by the principled living and extraordinary lives of the Shakers in America.</p>\r\n<p>The Hancock community was started in 1783 with the consolidation of land donated by converted farmers. Land acquisition and conversion continued for decades, with the acreage peaking at 3,000 and the population rising to over 300. It was the third of nineteen major Shaker villages established between 1783 and 1836 in New York, New England, Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana under the leadership of Joseph Meacham and Lucy Wright.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most notable buildings is the &ldquo;Round Stone Barn&rdquo;, built in 1826. The Round Stone Barn was created in a circular form for several reasons, the primary one being that the shape was simply the most convenient. Inside the barn there are four rings. The inner most is also the smallest and is simply for ventilation. This ventilation is necessary to help draw the moisture out of the hay, and to prevent it overheating. The next ring out is where the hay was stored. It was tossed in from an upper balcony that was over the outer two rings. The third ring out was where the Shaker brothers would walk to distribute the hay in the second ring to the cows standing in the outermost, fourth ring. The barn could hold up to 70 cows at a time. Normally, they would go to the barn twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening to be milked. Once inside the barn they would be put into wooden stantions. From there they would eat complacently while the brothers milked them. The floor of the outermost ring is split level, with the inner part raised up 3 inches so that the milk buckets are not on the same level as the manure.</p>\r\n<p>After reaching peak membership in the 1840s, the Shaker movement gradually dwindled, partially due to the urban migration that followed the Industrial Revolution. By the early twentieth century, the population of the village had fallen to around 50, most of which were children. Excess land was sold, and many buildings were destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>Hancock Shaker Village is a center for exploring what it means to live a principled life in the 21st century. Part of that process is to understand the impact of energy consumption on our selves, our community, and our world. We at Hancock Shaker Village look to the Shakers&rsquo; use of water, wind and other renewable energy sources as an inspiration for how we run the Village today.</p>\r\n<p>In September of 2012, SABIC Innovative Plastics undertook a 4-day agricultural infrastructure project focused on building high tunnel greenhouses that will expand the Village&rsquo;s CSA season as well as offer learning opportunities to HSV visitors. SABIC&rsquo;s monetary donation of $17,500, along with a donation of its LEXAN&trade; polycarbonate sheet, and over 600 hours of volunteer services, made it possible for the living history museum to perform the improvements. &ldquo;We have been touched by the personal commitment and financial investment SABIC has made to our facility over the course of the last several months,&rdquo; said HSV President &amp; CEO, Linda Steigleder. &ldquo;They have worked closely with our staff to design and install this important new resource.&rdquo; USDA funds helped to support the purchase of materials for the second greenhouse, and will also support the installation of a composting pad later in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>In late 2009, Hancock Shaker Village, in partnership with&nbsp;EOS Ventures&nbsp;and&nbsp;Alteris Renewables, installed both ground and roof-mounted solar panels at our modern Visitor Center complex. Part of a larger project with 6 other sites called The Berkshire Bundle, this system measures 89.6 killowatts, equal to about 1/3 of HSV&rsquo;s annual electricity consumption. Hancock Shaker Village did not pay for and does not own the equipment, but rather entered into a Power Purchase Agreement with the system&rsquo;s owner for a period of 20 years. The panels are connected to the grid with a net metering feature &ndash; if we generate more power than we actually need on a given day, then we send electricity to the grid and are credited for use at another time, effectively &ldquo;running the meter backwards.&rdquo;&nbsp;Click here&nbsp;to see the system&rsquo;s hourly, daily and lifetime energy production.</p>\r\n<p>2008-2010, Hancock Shaker Village participated in a 3 year project to plant, harvest, and evaluate the yield of crops that can be used to make biofuels.&nbsp; Managed by UMass research professors, the project used crops that are not suitable for food production, and on land that was not being used for food production. In a reclaimed Shaker garden area, we planted just under 1 acre of these Crambe, Switchgrass and Sunflower. To discover how the crops fare in varying soil types and weather patterns, crops were grown at multiple sites throughout Massachusetts.&nbsp;Researchers determined how much care the crops require, including the expense to grow and harvest them.&nbsp;Findings are being used to encourage farmers to grow biofuel crops, and to help ensure that Massachusetts continues to be a leader in developing alternative energies.</p>\r\n<p>Collaborating Organizations: Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation from the Green Pastures Fund, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Berkshire Biodiesel, Mass.

Isabella Stewart Gardner, known also as \"Mrs. Jack\" in reference to her husband, John L. (\"Jack\") Gardner, was one of the foremost female patrons of the arts. She was a patron and friend of leading artists and writers of her time, including John Singer Sargent, James McNeill Whistler, and Henry James. She was a supporter of community social services and cultural enrichment. She was an ardent fan of the Boston Symphony, the Red Sox, and Harvard College football. Isabella Stewart Gardner was also the visionary creator of what remains one of the most remarkable and intimate collections of art in the world today and a dynamic supporter of artists of her time, encouraging music, literature, dance, and creative thinking across artistic disciplines.</p>\r\n<p>Over three decades, Isabella Stewart Gardner traveled the world and worked with important art patrons and advisors Bernard Berenson and Okakura Kakuzo to amass a remarkable collection of master and decorative arts. In 1903, she completed the construction of Fenway Court in Boston to house her collection and provide a vital place for Americans to access and enjoy important works of art. Isabella Gardner installed her collection of works in a way to evoke intimate responses to the art, mixing paintings, furniture, textiles, and objects from different cultures and periods among well-known European paintings and sculpture.</p>\r\n<p>Isabella Stewart Gardner was born in New York City on April 14, 1840. She was the child of David Stewart, of Scottish descent, who made his fortune in the Irish linen trade and later in mining investments. Her mother was Adelia Smith, descendant of Richard Smith, an Englishman who had settled in Boston in 1650. She was named for her beloved paternal grandmother, Isabella Tod Stewart, herself a remarkable woman and successful farmer. (A portrait of her hangs in the museum.) Isabella Stewart Gardner was also a descendant of royal Stuarts (although this genealogy is spurious) and took great pride in this lineage.</p>\r\n<p>Isabella Stewart was educated at private schools in New York and Paris. Her first connection with Boston came through her schooling, between 1856 and 1858 in Paris, where a friendship with schoolmate Julia Gardner led to her eventual marriage to Julia\'s older brother John (\"Jack\") Lowell Gardner Jr. (1837-1898) on April 10, 1860. The couple was married in New York City and moved to Boston, Jack\'s hometown, where they settled into a house, a wedding gift from her father, at 152 Beacon Street in the Back Bay section of the city. In June 1863, Isabella Stewart Gardner gave birth to a son, John L. Gardner III, known as \"Jackie.\" At just two years of age, Jackie died of pneumonia in March 1865, and during the two years that followed his death, Isabella Stewart Gardner endured depression and illness. At a doctor\'s suggestion, John Gardner took his wife to Europe to travel throughout Scandinavia, Russia, Vienna, and Paris and, upon returning home, Isabella Gardner was in good health and spirits. Although the Gardners had no more children, they raised their three nephews following the death of Jack\'s widowed brother.</p>\r\n<p>Isabella Stewart Gardner had a zest for life, an energetic intellectual curiosity, and a love of travel. In 1874, Isabella and Jack Gardner went abroad again, visiting the Middle East, Central Europe, and Paris. Beginning in the late 1880s, they traveled frequently across America, Europe, and Asia to discover foreign cultures and expand their knowledge of art around the world. Isabella Stewart Gardner wrote fervently about her travels, revealing a great deal about her personality and inspirations. Isabella Stewart Gardner\'s favorite foreign destination was Venice, Italy. The Gardners regularly stayed at the Palazzo Barbaro, a major artistic center for a circle of American and English expatriates in Venice, and visited Venice\'s artistic treasures with amateur artist and former Bostonian, Ralph Curtis. While in Venice, Isabella Stewart Gardner bought art and antiques, attended the opera, and dined with expatriate artists, writers, and gadabouts. Her love of the city and of Italian culture inspired the design of her museum.</p>\r\n<p>Back in Boston, Isabella Gardner was an avid entertainer and frequent patron of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The Gardners hosted dinner parties with well-known guests, including author Henry James, writer Sarah Orne Jewett, philosopher George Santayana, and writer of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, Julia Ward Howe, as well as friends and artists like John Singer Sargent. The archives hold more than 7,000 letters from 1,000 correspondents as testaments to Isabella Gardner\'s social nature. These include glowing letters of thanks for dinner parties, concerts, and celebrations in her magnificent palazzo (\"Has the music room dissolved, this morning, in the sunshine? I felt last night as though I were in a Hans Anderson Fairy Tale, ready to go on a flying carpet at any moment,\" T.R. Sullivan, Jan. 10, 1902). Isabella Stewart Gardner was also interested in sports. She attended Red Sox games, boxing matches, and hockey and football games at Harvard College. She relished in horse races, particularly if her horse won. Her motto was \"Win as though you were used to it, and lose as if you like it.\"</p>\r\n<p>The local press was both fascinated and scandalized by her. Isabella Gardner did not conform to the traditional restraining code of conduct expected of Boston matrons in the Victorian era, but lived an engaging, exuberant life including much travel, entertaining, and adventure. She also had a sense of humor, however. Commenting on the numerous rumors and speculations about her escapades, many untrue, she is quoted as saying, \"Don\'t spoil a good story by telling the truth.\" As Isabella Stewart Gardner approached the end of her life, her desire to leave an endowment for the preservation of the museum forced her to be more financially conservative, and she often complained that the robber baron collectors, J. P. Morgan, Henry Frick, and Peter Widener-the \"squillionaires,\" as she called them-could outspend her on the acquisition of new works.</p>\r\n<p>In 1919, Isabella Stewart Gardner suffered the first of a series of strokes and died five years later, on July 17, 1924. Her will created an endowment of $1 million and outlined stipulations for the support of the museum, including that the permanent collection not be significantly altered. In keeping with her philanthropic nature, her will also left sizable bequests to the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Industrial School for Crippled and Deformed Children, Animal Rescue League and Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>\r\n<p>Isabella Stewart Gardner is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, between her husband and her son.</p>','',2,0,0,'@gardnermuseum','http://www.facebook.com/gardnermuseum','2013-03-12 20:41:01','2013-04-02 16:38:03',0,'isabella-stewart-gardner-museum'),(58,'Jacob\'s Pillow Dance','358 George Carter Road','Beckett','MA',1223,'http://www.jacobspillow.org/','04-6002993','<p>To support dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation; and to engage and deepen public appreciation and support for dance.</p>','<p>The mission of Jacob\'s Pillow Dance is to support dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation, and to engage and deepen public appreciation and support for dance.

With annual attendance of 120,000, it ranks among the most visited institutions in the United States dedicated to new art. More than 80 major new works of art and more than 50 performances have been created through fabrication and rehearsal residencies in North Adams, making MASS MoCA perhaps the most fertile site in the country for new art. The museum thrives on making and presenting work that is fresh, surprising, and challenging.</p>','<p>MASS MoCA is the largest center for contemporary arts in the United States. The institution is dedicated to the creation and presentation of provocative visual and performing arts pieces, and of works that blur conventional distinctions between artistic disciplines. In addition, MASS MoCA functions as a laboratory for the contemporary arts, fostering experimentation by artists, encouraging collaborations among institutions, and allowing visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process.</p>\r\n<p>The history of MASS MoCA\'s site spans more than two hundred years of economic, industrial, and architectural development that traces the trajectory of industrialism in New England. The 13 acres of grounds in North Adams, Massachusetts, encompass a vast complex of 19th-century factory buildings and occupy nearly one-third of the city\'s downtown business district. Listed in the National Historic Register, the site\'s 26 buildings form an elaborate system of interlocking courtyards and passageways rich with historical association. Bridges, viaducts, elevated walkways, and red brick facades lend a distinct architectural ambiance to the complex, which throughout its history has been a place for innovation and fabrication using the most advanced knowledge and technology of the day.</p>\r\n<p>Colonial Period (late 1700\'s&ndash;mid 1800\'s)<br />Manufacturing began on and around the site before the Revolutionary War, as its location at the confluence of the two branches of the Hoosic River was ideal for the diverse, small-scale industries of colonial times. By the late 1700\'s and early 1800\'s businesses at or near the site included: wholesale shoe manufacturers; a brick yard; a saw mill; cabinet-makers; hat manufacturers; machine shops for the construction of mill machines; marble works; wagon- and sleigh-makers; and an ironworks, which later forged armor plates for the Civil War ship, the Monitor.</p>\r\n<p>Arnold Print Works (1860&ndash;1942)<br />In 1860, the print works O. Arnold and Company established itself on a portion of the site and installed the latest equipment for printing cloth. Large government contracts to supply fabric for the Union Army ensured that the business prospered, and during the next four decades Arnold Print Works became the largest employer in North Adams. By the end of the 1890s, 25 of the 26 buildings in the present-day MASS MoCA complex had been constructed, and by 1905, Arnold Print Works employed some 3,200 people as one of the leading producers of printed textiles in the world. Despite decades of success, falling cloth prices and the lingering effects of the great Depression forced Arnold Print Works to close its Marshall Street operation in 1942, consolidating to smaller facilities in neighboring Adams, Massachusetts.</p>\r\n<p>Sprague Electric Company (1942&ndash;1985)<br />Later that year, the Sprague Electric Company bought the site. While largely leaving the building exteriors as they were, Sprague made extensive modifications to the interiors to convert the former textile mill into an electronics plant. Sprague physicists, chemists, electrical engineers, and skilled technicians were called upon by the U.S. government during World War II to design and manufacture crucial components of some of its most advanced high-tech weapons systems, including the atomic bomb.</p>\r\n<p>Outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment, Sprague was a major research and development center, conducting studies on the nature of electricity and semi-conducting materials. After the war, Sprague\'s products were used in the launch systems for Gemini moon missions, and by 1966 Sprague employed 4,137 workers in a community of 18,000, existing almost as a city within a city. From the post-war years to the mid-1980s Sprague produced electrical components for the booming consumer electronics market, but competition from lower-priced components produced abroad led to declining sales and, in 1985, the company closed its operations on Marshall Street.</p>\r\n<p>MASS MoCA (1986&ndash;present)<br />In 1986, just a year after Sprague\'s closing, the business and political leaders of North Adams were seeking ways to creatively re-use the vast Sprague complex.&nbsp;Williams College Museum of Art&nbsp;director Thomas Krens, who would later become Director of the&nbsp;Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, was looking for space to exhibit large works of contemporary art that would not fit in conventional museum galleries. When Mayor John Barrett III suggested the vast Marshall Street complex as a possible exhibition site, the idea of creating a contemporary arts center in North Adams began to take shape.</p>\r\n<p>Joseph C. Thompson, Krens\' colleague at the Williams College Museum of Art, was named founding director of MASS MoCA and spearheaded the project\'s launch. Thompson led the campaign to build political and community support for the proposed institution, which would serve as a platform for the creation and presentation of contemporary art, and develop links to the region\'s myriad cultural institutions. The Massachusetts legislature announced its support for the project in 1988. Subsequent economic upheaval in Massachusetts threatened the project, but broad-based support from the community and the private sector, which pledged more than $8 million, ensured that it continued to move forward.</p>\r\n<p>The feasibility study for MASS MoCA was led by renowned architects Simeon Bruner ofBruner/Cott &amp; Associates,&nbsp;Frank Gehry,&nbsp;Robert Venturi, and David Childs ofSkidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Bruner/Cott was named project architect in 1992 and, in 1995, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm completed the master plan and final designs.

Advertising is not accepted in its publications. Financial support for the Institute is provided primarily by the small annual fees from several thousand sustaining members, by receipts from sales of its publications, by tax-deductible contributions, and by the earnings of its wholly owned investment advisory organization, American Investment Services, Inc. Experience suggests that information and advice on economic subjects are most useful when they come from a source that is independent of special interests, either commercial or political.<br /><br />The provisions of the charter and bylaws ensure that neither the Institute itself nor members of its staff may derive profit from organizations or businesses that happen to benefit from the results of Institute research. Institute financial accounts are available for public inspection during normal working hours of the Institute.</p>\r\n<p>By 1934, the magnitude of the Great Depression suggested the need for a research organization to inquire into the wide range of economic, social, and monetary developments that had contributed to the catastrophic economic contraction. The hope was that by further developing and applying modern scientific procedures of inquiry, results could be obtained that would be useful to the Nation in avoiding a repetition of the disaster. On the advice of Dr. Vannevar Bush, then vice-president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Col. E. C. Harwood founded American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) to conduct the necessary research.</p>\r\n<p>Initially AIER was housed in the office of a staff member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but soon expansion required more space. For several years the Institute occupied buildings in Cambridge, Massachusetts that it also soon outgrew.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the Second World War, Col. E. C. Harwood and Helen Harwood investigated the potential of several \"white elephants\" in Berkshire County, Massachusetts as a new home for AIER. After successful negotiations, they moved operations to Great Barrington. After several months of preparing the new location, AIER resumed full operation at its new location with plenty of room for future expansion.</p>\r\n<p>By 1956 subscription and book sales had outgrown its allotted space. In 1957, the mailing and printing were transferred to an annex. In 1958, a warehouse was added to the annex to accommodate increasing volumes of paper, envelopes, and mail.</p>\r\n<p>To accommodate the expansion of research staff, students, and books, in 1962 a research library was added to the hillside below the annex. Now known as the E. C. Harwood Library, the 20,000 square-foot building contains AIER\'s principal offices.</p>\r\n<p>AIER\'s independence from special-interest groups - and its close attention not only to proposed solutions of fundamental economic problems but also to useful procedures of inquiry into those problems - makes AIER unique among economic research organizations. AIER\'s long-run success attests the need for economic research carried out in such a manner.</p>\r\n<p>Col. Harwood, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, was serving in the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1920s when he undertook as an avocation the intensive study of economics, with particular emphasis on money-credit problems. He began with economic texts by authors whose names began with \"A\" and exhausted a library in less than three years. He found chaos among economists\' views arising from semantic mires and pre-scientific notions about human \"knowledge.\"</p>\r\n<p>He next began intensive study of what philosophers and logicians had said about knowing, finding there, too, muddled inquiries. Some American philosophers, Charles S. Peirce and William James, were different and had broken with ancient traditions by incorporating scientific procedures. Later, John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley furthered scientific analysis with their development of a \"transactional\" approach to \"problem solving.\" Since its beginning, AIER has recognized the importance of developing and adhering to such useful procedures of inquiry as antecedent and inseparably linked to inquiry in all fields, including economics.</p>\r\n<p>In 1928 and 1929 Col. Harwood warned in several articles published in the financial journals that the speculative \"boom\" then underway was attributable primarily to the excessive creation of purchasing media and that the failure to stop the inflating process would lead to a major \"bust.\"</p>\r\n<p>By 1933 the magnitude of the Great Depression suggested the need for an independent research organization to inquire into the wide range of economic, social, and monetary developments that had contributed to the catastrophic economic contraction. Col. Harwood deemed necessary that such an organization avoid financial dependence on a few individuals or groups with pet panaceas or special interests. Vice President Vannevar Bush of MIT suggested that an independent research organization offering its results directly to the public might be possible.</p>\r\n<p>With $200 Col. Harwood began operations in 1933. Since its inception, the Institute\'s publications have enjoyed a wide sale, and thousands of Sustaining Members provide a financial base for its work.</p>','http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=VEjtlVXL4z0',1,0,0,'@AIER','http://www.facebook.com/AmericanInstituteForEconomicResearch?fref=ts','2013-03-16 13:38:03','2013-03-21 17:25:47',0,'american-institute-for-economic-research'),(83,'American Ireland Fund','211 Congress Street 10th Floor','Boston','MA',2110,'http://theirelandfunds.org/','25-1306992','<p>The Worldwide Ireland Funds are a philanthropic network that supports worthy causes in Ireland and around the world.

Today, Dan Rooney serves as U.S. Ambassador to Ireland.Over the following decade, The Ireland Fund formed a thriving fundraising network of chapters in cities across the U.S. including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Palm Beach, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington D.C.

Since its founding, the American Textile History Museum (ATHM) has expanded its mission, changed its name, and relocated to its present home in historic Lowell., Massachusetts. It has been accredited by the American Association of Museums since 1973.</p>\r\n<p>During its first thirty years, the Museum documented the woolen, cotton, flax and silk industries in New England and beyond through its collections of pre-industrial tools, powered industrial era machinery, flat textiles and the rich collections of its Osborne Library.</p>\r\n<p>The Museum supported research and publication, hosted conferences, presented exhibitions and public programming. It also developed a model program with the public schools of neighboring Lawrence, Massachusetts. In 1977, the Textile Conservation Center was established as a department of the Museum.</p>\r\n<p>By the mid 1980s, under the directorship of Tom Leavitt, the Museum set out to expand its public dimension via exhibitions and expanded museum educational programming for schools and the general public. It also sought to bring its extensive collections into a single, unified curatorial and storage facility.</p>\r\n<p>In 1992, the Museum purchased the Kitson Building in Lowell and began a fundraising campaign, to support the renovations to this historic building. Led by Director Paul Rivard, the building was renovated , the core exhibition&nbsp;Textiles in America&nbsp;was designed and installed and the Museum opened to the public in April, 1997. Under Rivard&rsquo;s guidance the Museum expanded its educational services to include the Lowell Public Schools, and initiated the special changing exhibitions program.</p>\r\n<p>Under the leadership of Michael J. Smith, who was the Museum&rsquo;s President/CEO from 2000 through 2005, the Museum formulated its current mission statement; greatly expanded its educational programs, began programs for scouts, opened the&nbsp;Textile Learning Center&nbsp;for families, and spearheaded innovative special exhibitions. Also during Mr. Smith&rsquo;s tenure, the Chace Foundation awarded the Museum with a substantial grant to access portions of the Museum&rsquo;s collections on the internet, and the American Textile Hall of Fame, a program honoring individuals, corporations and organization from the world of textiles, was initiated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An organizational restructuring of the Museum began in 2006. James S. Coleman was named interim Executive Director in January to help meet the challenge of funding the Museum&rsquo;s operations and to formulate a plan to take the Museum forward. The Textile Conservation Center closed as a department of the Museum later that month and in April the Museum successfully negotiated an agreement to sell part of its Dutton Street building for conversion into mixed-use space including residential lofts, and the home of The Sun, the region&rsquo;s daily newspaper.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;Chace Catalogue&nbsp;came on-line in June 2006, enabling visitors to the Museum&rsquo;s website to gain access to key portions of its curatorial and storage facilities through the technology of a virtual museum. Mr. Coleman succeeded in crafting a strategic plan and a preliminary budget to renovate and strengthen the Museum in order to achieve growth and financial stability, and the Board of Trustees agreed to move forward with the plan to build its future in Lowell. In July of 2006, Mr. Coleman accepted the permanent position of President/CEO. Over the next two and a half years, Mr. Coleman and the ATHM team worked to renovate theTextiles in America&nbsp;core exhibition to bring it into the 21st century.</p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Campaign for the American Textile History Museum&rdquo; was launched in 2006, with a goal to raise $1.5 million to fund the Museum&rsquo;s renovation, $1 million for its endowment, and $1.4 million for operating costs. As part of that campaign, the Museum launched a $1 million challenge to grow its endowment and ensure the preservation of its collections, which was matched dollar for dollar by Deborah S. Pulliam, a noted textile artist, historian and writer from Maine. Sadly, Ms. Pulliam passed away only a day after the endowment goal was met in May 2007. A Museum endowment has been established in her name, and a knitting display in the renovated exhibit named in her honor. The ambitious $3.9 million &ldquo;Campaign for the American Textile History Museum&rdquo; goal was reached in August 2008.</p>\r\n<p>The renovated exhibit,&nbsp;Textile Revolution: An Exploration through Space and Time&nbsp;opened in June 2009, when the Museum announced its affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution at this time. In 2010, the Museum celebrated its 50th anniversary. In November 2011, Jonathan Stevens assumed the role of President and CEO. Mr. Stevens, the son of textile entrepreneur Edward Stevens, is the former CEO of Ames Textile Corporation in Lowell and served previously as a Trustee and Treasurer of the Museum. On March 15, 2012 Jonathan Stevens was named the new President and CEO of the American Textile History Museum.</p>','',3,0,0,'@ATHMlowell','http://www.facebook.com/athmlowell?ref=ts','2013-03-16 13:44:16','2013-03-21 17:25:47',0,'american-textile-history-museum'),(85,'Angel Flight Northeast','492 Sutton Street','North Andover','MA',1845,'http://www.angelflightne.org/','04-3314346','<p>We are a volunteer corps of over&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;private pilots&nbsp;and \"Earth Angels\" who combine our love of flying with the spirit of grassroots volunteerism by flying patients and their families to the critical health care they need.

Larry Camerlin answered his calling and founded Angel Flight&nbsp;NE in March 1996.</p>\r\n<p>With pro bono counsel from attorney Nicholas Hodge at the Boston law firm of Hill &amp; Barlow, Angel Flight NE was incorporated in March 1996 and soon thereafter the IRS granted&nbsp;us 501 (c)(3) non-profit tax-exempt status. Using a small office space donated by the Beverly&nbsp;Flight Center, our flight operations began on May 31, 1996 with 10 volunteer pilots and two requests for flights.</p>\r\n<p>Angel Flight has been able to provide free flights because of the generous support of donors and volunteers.&nbsp;Private pilots&nbsp;donate their time, planes, feul, and resources to provide free air transportation for AFNE\'s passengers.

In the wake of both these tragedies, Angel Flight was the first in the air, quickly mobilizing pilots, aviation officials, and volunteers to provide flights for the victims and their families.</p>\r\n<p>In the weeks following the devasting earthquake in Haiti, AFNE pilots participated in Haitian relief efforts.&nbsp; They flew tents, supplies and medical staff into the ravaged country.</p>\r\n<p>Fifteen years after its inception, Angel Flight NE has flown over&nbsp;9 million miles--about 100 missions per week--all to help people in their times of greatest need.

The MSPCA helped the group through an 18-month transition period. Today, BHS is an independent organization with no ties to or support from the MSPCA or any other animal support group.</p>\r\n<p>The dogs, cats, rabbits and other small animals that reside at BHS while awaiting their forever homes live and play in a spacious, light-filled state-of-the art building that was opened to the public in July 2003. Dogs are housed in privacy suites or a glass-enclosed kennel that does not open to the outside. Instead, staff members or volunteers walk each dog on the spacious shelter grounds at least three times every day. Cats luxuriate either in their own &ldquo;condo&rdquo; in a U-shaped cat mall or in a large feature room complete with ladders, tree houses, and toys.

In 2011 over 1,300 animals were either surrendered to the shelter by their owners or brought to the shelter by animal control officers or concerned citizens. All of the adoptable dogs and&nbsp;100 percent of the adoptable cats were placed in forever homes.</p>\r\n<p>Before leaving BHS with their adoptive families, all dogs, cats, and rabbits are spayed or neutered through a cooperative program with area veterinarians.

We interpret this trend as an indication of the success of our efforts to have Berkshire County domestic pets spayed or neutered. BHS actively educates the public about the importance of spaying and neutering, and we participate in state and local programs to help defray some of the costs of spaying and neutering for those unable to pay the entire cost themselves.

From that meeting, Big Brothers Association of Boston was formed in 1949. Created as a non-sectarian, interracial, interfaith service, in its first year, ten Big Brothers were matched with Little Brothers.&nbsp;<br /><br />For several decades the agency grew and changed. In the late 1990s, we began matching girls and women in response to a request from Big Brothers Big Sisters of America to serve the Cape Ann area. In 2006, we merged with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cape Cod and the Islands, and acquired Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Attleboro &ndash; two agencies serving both boys and girls. At this time, to better reflect the regions and children we serve, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America granted our name change to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay.

And we have over a century of volunteers, donors, and advocates just like you to thank.</p>\r\n<p>It all started in 1904, when a young New York City court clerk named Ernest Coulter was seeing more and more boys come through his courtroom. He recognized that caring adults could help many of these kids stay out of trouble, and he set out to find volunteers.

Their desire to serve unfolded into a mission that would continue throughout and beyond the next century. The Boston Rescue Mission was founded on March 14, 1899 by these five pioneers in a tiny vacant property on 128 Merrimac Street. After a few months, they relocated to 134 Merrimac Street, now occupied by the Celtics administrative offices near the TD Banknorth Garden. Prior to the formation of the Mission, the tenants at that location had run a saloon. When the Mission became incorporated in 1904, it was then described as \"a bar-room transformed into a life-saving station.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 1908, the Mission moved to 105 Staniford Street, a section of town that at this time was much more in need of shelter services. In 1965, the redevelopment that was taking place in the West End forced the Mission to move again, this time to Massachusetts Avenue.

As an essential part of their overall care, the House provides its guests with low-cost and convenient accommodations in a safe and comfortable home-like setting. Here, children, families, and caregivers find comfort and support among staff, volunteers, and other families facing the life-changing realities of childhood cancer and other life-threatening hematological illnesses.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','<p>The Boston Ronald McDonald House opened its doors in Brookline in 1979, establishing itself as the eighth House in the country. The House was a dream of the Friends of the Jimmy Fund, a group of parents whose children were treated for cancer at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Jimmy Fund Clinic. With the support of local McDonald&rsquo;s Restaurant owner/operators and hundreds of generous people, companies and foundations, this dream became reality. Since its opening, thousands of children with cancer and their families have lived in the &ldquo;House that love built&rdquo; at minimal or no cost and with much support.</p>\r\n<p>When the Boston Ronald McDonald House opened in 1979, we could only accommodate 10 families each night. Over the years, the House has grown to keep pace with the latest in medical treatment. In 1985, the House built six Bone Marrow Transplant Recovery apartments &ndash; the first units of their kind in the country, to accommodate families with children recovering from this life-saving, yet fragile procedure. In 1993 we expanded again, adding more studio apartments that offer families the protection their children need to recuperate in a &ldquo;home-away-from-home,&rdquo; complete with their own kitchen, bathroom, living room, and sleeping area. As a result of our expansion, we can now accommodate up to 22 families a night!</p>\r\n<p>For over 30 years, the Boston Ronald McDonald House has provided a &ldquo;home-away-from-home&rdquo; to families who have children with cancer and other life-threatening hematological diseases. But the House is much bigger than its 22 rooms. The House is about heart and about love of donors, volunteers, and families; it&rsquo;s about giving and about support. As one family wrote, &ldquo;Sometimes people come into your life who make such a difference, you are changed forever. That is the way I feel about all of you at the Boston Ronald McDonald House. When you are so far from loved ones and friends with such a serious problem, it is almost impossible to think that strangers can be so loving and giving. But, of course, none of us stayed strangers for long.

It was the central office for the parish guilds in the Archdiocese of Boston. From the beginning, voluntary support was vital, especially from the women in the guilds who raised funds to help the blind. The Guild provided financial aid, clothing, organized reading circles, employment-seeking assistance, talking books, recreational activities, and transportation. In 1938,&nbsp;Father Thomas Carroll&nbsp;became assistant director.</p>\r\n<p>The first Community Mobility Program in the world was established at The Carroll Center in 1952 to teach safe travel skills to blind and visually impaired persons.</p>\r\n<p>In 1954, St. Paul&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Center was founded. It was the nation&rsquo;s first comprehensive residential rehabilitation center for newly-blinded civilians, based on the successful Veteran&rsquo;s Administration programs for post WW II veterans and for which Fr. Carroll played a significant role in its development.</p>\r\n<p>Fencing for the blind was one of many innovative ideas thatFather Carroll&nbsp;incorporated into the rehabilitation program to help blinded persons develop balance, dexterity, and coordination necessary for cane travel.</p>\r\n<p>Always seeking to improve the circumstances and opportunities for blind persons, Fr. Carroll founded the American Center for Research in Blindness in 1963. It called upon researchers from many disciplines to apply the latest knowledge, innovation, and inventions to assist blind persons. Without his guiding spirit, the center was unable to continue beyond his untimely death in 1971.</p>\r\n<p>Also in the third decade, Fr. Carroll established Saint Raphael&rsquo;s Geriatric Adjustment Center (1965) for older blind persons. This was the first known center of its kind in the world. The model for this Center differed from St. Paul&rsquo;s center for newly blinded adults in a number of important ways. Admissions were weekly and the length of stay was open-ended. Fr. felt that it was important to take elderly trainees into the program whenever they felt ready. A medical director was appointed and a full-time nurse was on the premises. One of the duties of the medical team was to conduct a comprehensive review of medications. At that time, before managed care, many elderly persons were often over-prescribed &mdash; sometimes with competing drugs.</p>\r\n<p>The fourth decade brought the untimely death of&nbsp;Father Thomas J. Carroll&nbsp;in 1971. A pioneering leader in developing rehabilitation services for the newly blinded adult, he was at the height of his career. With his innovative approach to services gone, the blind community had lost a leader; the agency had lost its direction and momentum. The impact was profound on the agency, and there was concern about its future. In 1972, the Guild was renamed The Carroll Center for the Blind to honor&nbsp;Father Carrolland to keep his name and his achievements alive.</p>\r\n<p>Innovation, by this time, was coming from the technology industry. The year Father died, the Optacon, a prototype reading machine for the blind, was developed. It was a remarkable breakthrough. It could optically scan standard printed material and emit signals to create a raised letter display of words through vibrations that could be read by the fingertip. It was the beginning of the introduction of adaptive technology that would eventually help blind persons live more independently, but it would also challenge the need for structured programs of rehabilitation.</p>\r\n<p>Rachel Rosenbaum was hired as Executive Director in 1976, which would ultimately prove to be a fitting replacement for the leadership and long-time direction that Fr. Carroll had provided, bringing the Carroll Center back into the forefront of local and national leadership in the field of blindness. The Center embarked upon the renovation of its facilities to best accommodate the changing needs of the blind community. The Center sold one of its buildings reducing its 7.5 acre campus to 5.5 acres, while using the proceeds to remodel its main facility, a turn-of-the-century carriage house, for training classrooms and office use, completed in 1981.</p>\r\n<p>The Carroll Center developed a new program for providing access to outdoor recreation activities and established low vision training and assessments; teaching the practical uses of remaining functional vision and the application of high magnification. Advances in optical technology and low-vision aids now enabled many visually-impaired persons to use remaining sight more effectively.</p>\r\n<p>In a continued effort to bring the campus facilities up to date, a beautiful English Tudor style building was completely renovated as a dormitory residence for clients, while maintaining the charm and character of the building to become a home away from home for clients while undergoing the process of rehabilitation.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to its leadership role in the rehabilitation training of blind adults, the Center opened an Educational Services department and began providing educational support to blind children in public school classrooms throughout Massachusetts.</p>\r\n<p>In line with Fr. Carroll&rsquo;s tradition of developing unique opportunities for blind persons to flourish, the Center&rsquo;s SailBlind Program sent a group of blind sailors to New Zealand to compete in the first Blind Sailing World Championships.</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, 2002, the new state-of-the-art Technology Center opened, providing training for blind children and adults on the latest computer software and hardware for education, employment, and personal use. These devices include talking computers, large-print displays, and Braille output that can be proofread by fingertip touch.</p>\r\n<p>The computer revolution is providing tremendous career opportunities for blind or partially-sighted persons, and once again, the Carroll Center is on the leading edge. Blind persons are given intensive, hands-on instruction in using the latest adaptive technology.</p>\r\n<p>The Center remodeled the St. Paul&rsquo;s building, once used by Fr. Carroll for the first residential rehabilitation program in 1954, to now house the Community Mobility offices and the newly expanded Educational Services programs, providing special summer and school vacation learning programs to supplement the ongoing classroom educational support.</p>','http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HePVCt8FivI&list=UUZKfcc7Yd8ckf6erzMDzuaw&index=1',1,0,0,'@CarrollCenter','http://www.facebook.com/CarrollCenter','2013-03-16 16:18:38','2013-03-21 17:25:48',0,'carroll-center-for-the-blind'),(101,'Cell Phones for Soldiers','243 Winter Street','Norwell','MA',2061,'http://www.cellphonesforsoldiers.com/','20-1343425','<p>Cell Phones for Soldiers Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to providing cost-free communication services to active duty military members and veterans.&nbsp;</p>','<p>Since its inception in 2004, Cell Phones for Soldiers has worked to keep military families connected by providing FREE communication tools to those serving overseas in the United States military.

The model\'s developer, Stanley Pollack, began his career in 1973 as a street outreach worker for the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, and the basic components of the model were created over the next eight years in Somerville. From 1982 to 1992, Stanley built a successful consulting practice, implementing the model in communities throughout Massachusetts. In July 1992, with the support of the Boston Foundation and the Hayden and Riley Foundations, he founded The Center for Teen Empowerment, Inc. in order to demonstrate both the power of the TE Model to generate solutions to difficult problems that confront urban communities and the model\'s potential applications in a wide range of social service and educational settings.</p>\r\n<p>The Center began work in Boston\'s South End/Lower Roxbury community by hiring a group of 14 teens as youth organizers. Through the TE training process, these youth identified their initial goal of finding solutions to the epidemic of gang violence that had taken the lives of several of their friends and was filling their neighborhoods with hatred and fear. The strategy they developed included organizing a series of community meetings for youth, police, and adults. This process culminated in the first Youth Peace Conference in May 1993, which brought together five rival gangs to create a peace treaty.</p>\r\n<p>As an integral part of these community change initiatives, the young people emphasized the connection between gang violence and the lack of jobs and educational opportunities available to urban youth. In addition, they highlighted the pervasive racial and class biases that were helping fuel the rage that many urban youth were expressing through gang-related and other destructive and self-destructive activities. They successfully focused their organizing efforts to push the city, local businesses, and media outlets to expand youth employment programs. Over the next several years, Teen Empowerment youth organizers implemented strategies that encouraged the Boston Police Department to increase community policing programs and decrease the practice of negatively profiling neighborhood youth.</p>\r\n<p>In the spring of 1994, Teen Empowerment received funding from the Riley Foundation to bring the TE Model into the context of a Boston public high school, thus beginning a 13-year presence in the schools. TE\'s first school-based site opened at Madison Park Technical Vocational High School in September. In 1996 and 1997, TE opened sites at two district high schools, first at the English High School, then at Dorchester High (now the Dorchester Education Complex). Schools sites used the TE Model to systematically involve young people in analyzing their school community, determining the priority issues that needed to be addressed, and then developing and carrying out strategies to address the identified issues.</p>\r\n<p>TE\'s community-based work began expanding in 2003 with a site in Rochester, NY. In 2004, TE opened a site in Somerville, MA. In 2006 and 2007, TE opened sites in two neighborhoods of Boston: first in the Bowdoin/Geneva area of Dorchester, then in Egleston Square, Roxbury.</p>\r\n<p>All sites use the TE Model to systematically involve young people in analyzing their school community, determining the priority issues that need to be addressed, and then developing and carrying out strategies to address the identified issues.</p>\r\n<p>Teen Empowerment has organized hundreds of school and community reform initiatives since 1992, and our focus continues to be on youth organizing--developing effective strategies that involve youth in creating positive social and institutional change in their communities and schools. In recent years TE has also expanded its work to include&nbsp;adapting the model\'s component parts&nbsp;as tools to increase productivity in adult work settings and to enhance the effectiveness of other youth and educational service providers. This work includes designing and facilitating training sessions for teachers, police, and human service and youth service providers; developing curricula for schools, residential treatment facilities, and vocational training programs; and developing&nbsp;materials&nbsp;that make Teen Empowerment methods available to all.</p>','http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOC1uJMPiME&list=UURdnHCTRCSMqzhMQM1cLAcA&index=1',9,0,0,'','http://www.facebook.com/groups/14694955577/','2013-03-16 16:23:09','2013-03-21 17:25:48',0,'the-center-for-teen-empowerment'),(103,'Center for Women & Enterprise','24 School Street Suite 700','Boston','MA',2108,'http://www.cweonline.org/','04-3256236','<div id=\"dnn_contentpane\">\r\n<div id=\"dnn_ctr755_ContentPane\">\r\n<div id=\"dnn_ctr755_ModuleContent\">\r\n<div id=\"dnn_ctr755_Display_HtmlHolderDiv\">\r\n<p>CWE\'s mission is to empower women to become economically self-sufficient and to prosper through business and entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"bottomcols\">\r\n<div id=\"dnn_column1pane\"><a name=\"783\"></a>\r\n<div id=\"dnn_ctr783_ContentPane\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','<p>When Andrea Silbert returned to her hometown of Boston in 1994 after a two-year stint in South America, she brought with her an idea for a non-profit micro-lending institution for women entrepreneurs. She joined forces with co-founder Susan Hammond. Andrea and Susan\'s vision was to create an inclusive organization to help women from every imaginable background and orientation to start and grow their own businesses. Most importantly, they wanted to build a community that included disadvantaged women and women with greater experience and education so that they could learn from one another.</p>\r\n<p>After extensive research and discussions with various aspiring women entrepreneurs, it became clear that women really needed education and training as much as access to capital. In particular, for economically disadvantaged women with limited formal business training, it seemed that education was the essential ingredient. Education helps empower women to become economically self-sufficient and breaking the cycle of poverty. Furthermore, when coupled with training, education provides women the skills to launch and build successful businesses.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 1995, the Center for Women &amp; Enterprise officially opened in Boston with founding grants of $150,000 from the U.S. Small Business Administration, $100,000 from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, $50,000 from the Bank of Boston and $50,000 from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Operating out of donated space at Northeastern University with a budget of just $350,000 and three full-time staff members, this small, local organization served a few hundred women and set the foundation for great things to come.</p>\r\n<p>Under the leadership of CEO Andrea Silbert, during its first year CWE expanded its staff, programs and client base to serve over 500 women.In 1998, CWE pioneered an initiative to assist women entrepreneurs in accessing equity capital called theCWE Women\'s Venture Center. Recognizing the need to increase and strengthen corporate supplier diversity initiatives, CWE also became the New England regional women\'s business organization partner to the Women\'s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), a national organization which certifies women around the country to increase supplier diversity opportunities between women owned businesses, Fortune 500 companies, and the U.S. Government.</p>\r\n<p>CWE continued its expansion by launching the&nbsp;Community Entrepreneurs Program&nbsp;(CEP) in 1999, which was designed to address barriers faced by very low-income women starting home-based businesses. Many of the women enrolled in CEP were single mothers, and CWE made sure to help provide transportation and child care to them during class time. Both the Women\'s Venture Center and the Community Entrepreneurs Program have been recognized as groundbreaking initiatives that continue to serve as national models.In 1999, working closely with Congressman Jim McGovern, among others, CWE opened a Worcester, MA office. Initial support came from the Commonwealth, the City of Worcester and the Greater Worcester Community Foundation. After several years, the Worcester office won a 5-year, $150,000 grant from the US Small Business Administration to expand its work.</p>\r\n<p>The year 2000 marked the opening of another regional office in Providence, Rhode Island. The Providence office was opened with the same grant from the US SBA, and matching funds from the Human Resources Investment Council of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Foundation and Fleet BIn 1999, working closely with Congressman Jim McGovern, among others, CWE opened a Worcester, MA office. Initial support came from the Commonwealth, the City of Worcester and the Greater Worcester Community Foundation. After several years, the Worcester office won a 5-year, $150,000 grant from the US Small Business Administration to expand its work.</p>\r\n<p>CWE hosted the first annual Springboard Venture Capital Forum at Harvard Business School in 2000. The program is the first and only venture capital forum showcasing women-led firms.</p>\r\n<p>During the following year, the&nbsp;Community Entrepreneurs Program&nbsp;was integrated into other start-up courses to create a more comprehensive modular program, addressing the needs of women entrepreneurs at each step of their business development. CWE also began offering intensive one-on-one consulting and loan packaging services to help women bring their business to the next level.</p>\r\n<p>2004 was an important year of change for CWE, marked by Andrea Silbert\'s decision to leave the helm of CWE after nearly nine years. The torch was passed to Donna Mullen Good, a Massachusetts native with years of political, governmental, and nonprofit managerial and fundraising experience. Donna\'s commitment to CWE\'s original</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>vision, combined with her energy for positive change, continued to make CWE a stronger agent for the empowerment of women. In 2008 Susan Rittscher was selected to become CWE&rsquo;s new CEO. Bringing 17 years of experience as a CEO at the YMCA, an expertise in leadership development and passion for creating new opportunities for women, Susan is committed to advancing the mission and expanding CWE&rsquo;s offerings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now in its 16th year, CWE&rsquo;s staff members and hundreds of volunteers serve approximately 2,500 clients every year.

It is through service that we can demonstrate the power and idealism of young people, engage citizens to benefit the common good, and develop young leaders of the next generation.</p>','<p>City Year is wholly focused on fighting the national dropout crisis. We have committed to leverage the talent, energy and idealism of corps members to serve as tutors, mentors and role models in schools to help students stay on track &ndash; and get back on track &ndash; to graduate.</p>\r\n<p>Our corps members do this by focusing on three early warning indicators that have been defined through research: attendance, behavior and course performance in math and English.</p>\r\n<p>City Year&rsquo;s In School &amp; On Track initiative is designed to bring City Year corps members to 50% of all of the students falling off track in City Year&rsquo;s 24 U.S. locations, which will require expanding the number of corps members to 6,000 and engaging school districts, the private sector and the federal government through AmeriCorps as partners.</p>\r\n<p>City Year was founded in 1988 by Michael Brown and Alan Khazei, then-roommates at Harvard Law School, who felt strongly that young people in service could be a powerful resource for addressing America\'s most pressing issues.</p>\r\n<p>They built City Year with the conviction that one person can make a difference; and since its inception, City Year has promoted the vision of service as a common expectation &ndash; and a real opportunity &ndash; for citizens all around the world.</p>\r\n<p>City Year&rsquo;s vision is that one day the most commonly asked question of a young person will be,&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are you going to do your service year?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>City Year is currently serving in 24 cities across the United States and in two international affiliate sites located in Johannesburg, South Africa and London, England.</p>\r\n<p>City Year&rsquo;s work in schools is strengthened by its deep history in community service. Since 1988, City Year has been a leader in the growing national service movement, leading to the establishment of AmeriCorps, the passage of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, and the creation of Voices for National Service.</p>\r\n<p>City Year applies the principles of national service to our work with students and, in doing so, builds awareness and support for national and international service initiatives.</p>\r\n<p>City Year is a proud member of the Voices for National Service and ServiceNation coalitions.</p>','http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtAqyobu4EI',9,1,1,'@CityYear','http://www.facebook.com/cityyear','2013-03-16 16:36:53','2013-04-01 16:32:09',0,'city-year'),(107,'American Lung Association of the Northeast ','60 Totten Pond Rd ','Waltham','MA',2451,'http://www.lung.org','','<p>The American Lung Association is the leading organization in the Northeast working to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease.</p>','<p style=\"margin: 0.33em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 15px; text-align: left;\">As America&rsquo;s oldest voluntary health organization, founded in 1904, we began our fight dedicated to combating tuberculosis (TB), the most dreaded disease at the time.

Our successes include permanent protection (through new federal legislation) for the headwaters of the Snake River, for 1.3 million acres in the Wyoming Range at the southern end of the Ecosystem, and consolidation of public and private lands left after the railroad land grants of the 1800s, resulting in 55,000 acres of new public land and habitat in the north end of the Ecosystem.One of our most dramatic successes was stopping the New World Gold Mine proposed just 1.5 miles from the border of Yellowstone National Park. We have also had a long-term effect on public attitudes toward public land, helping to move the Forest Service from a single-minded focus on commodity production to an understanding of the need to protect watersheds, forests and wildlife habitat as well.<br /><br /> For 30 years we have been the voice that works to protect Yellowstone National Park and the lands, waters, and wildlife in and around it.

Public Campaign is laying the foundation for reform by working with a broad range of organizations, including local community groups, around the country that are fighting for change and national organizations whose members are not fairly represented under the current campaign finance system. Together we are building a network of national and state-based efforts to create a powerful national force for federal and state campaign reform.</p>','<p>For sixteen years, Public Campaign has been a leading organization in national efforts to combat the big-money interest funding of American political campaigns. We expose the inequities and damaging consequences of the current campaign fundraising system and educate the public about the democratic promise inherent in robust publicly financed campaign systems based on small donor matching. Public Campaign works closely with the separate Public Campaign Action Fund (PCAF), a 501(c)(4) organization.<br /><br /> We have worked with state activists across the country, most notably in Arizona, Connecticut, and Maine, to generate public enthusiasm for local models of Fair Elections&mdash;systems of publicly financed candidate campaigns. Under this policy, candidates may choose to run a financially competitive campaign utilizing only a combination of small contributions and money from a public fund. In 2006, we expanded this conversation to the national level while our sister organization, PCAF, worked on a new initiative to win publicly financed Congressional elections.<br /><br /> Following the Citizens United court decision and the 2010 elections, we refocused our efforts and committed increased resources to deepening anti-big money coalition efforts that exposed the damage caused by pay-to-play politics on social, economic, and environmental policy making. These efforts intensified in 2012 as more and more groups new to the issue sought our advice and partnership. They reached out to us based on their shared recognition that progress on their policy goals would be virtually impossible unless authentically democratic electoral and governing practices were restored.<br /><br /> At the urging of such groups, as well as our own recognition of the need for more focused outreach to grassroots activists who want to work on this issue, we are rolling out a unique training program &ndash; building a new generation of Fair Elections proponents through a carefully designed and tested curriculum we will share across multiple platforms, from conference workshops to do-it-yourself on-line training. Thus, while remaining lean and nimble, we will be doing our utmost to deepen and expand the Fair Elections movement across the country.<br /><br /> The campaign cash bacchanal of 2012 seems to have left the country with an enduring sense of regret and a growing hunger for the democracy we thought we had. As a consequence, and, as we hope this proposal has demonstrated, we see unique opportunities converging to build a movement powerful enough to put people back in &ndash; and take big money out of &ndash; the election process.

This progressive and frequently fatal disease, which scientists have determined to be a systemic neoplasm that results in cystic destruction of the lung, affects women almost exclusively, primarily in their childbearing years. Scientists estimate that there are as many as 300,000 women with LAM who are currently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.<br /><br /> Three primary goals for the Foundation:<br /><br /> Patient Services - The Foundation conducted the first-ever LAM patient/family conference in 1997. Now this annual conference, the International LAM Research Conference (LAMposium), offers a three day, dual-track meeting for the LAM scientific and patient communities. The Foundation also provides an extraordinary network of support to women with LAM worldwide through the LAM Liaison program, printed materials, community forums, telephone calls, and emails.<br /> Research - The LAM Foundation research program has produced 91 grant awards to LAM investigators, totaling $9.3 million. With adequate research funding, we believe a cure for this disease will be uncovered through scientific investigation.<br /> LAM Clinics - To improve the care and treatment of all LAM patients, The LAM Foundation has established 26 LAM Clinics throughout the US.

In response, a group of concerned individuals and institutions founded the Black Rhino Foundation in 1989 to assist in the conservation of black rhinos in Zimbabwe through efforts in the wild and in captivity. In part because of the Black Rhino Foundation&rsquo;s support, poaching was virtually eliminated and Zimbabwe&rsquo; black rhino population began to stabilize. In most areas throughout the species&rsquo; range, numbers are now increasing. In 1993, recognizing that the escalating crisis facing all five rhino species was not receiving the attention it deserved, the Black Rhino Foundation expanded its mission and became the International Rhino Foundation (IRF). The International Rhino Foundation is dedicated to the survival of the world&rsquo;s rhino species through conservation and research. At the heart of IRF&rsquo;s vision is the belief that these magnificent species should endure for future generations, and that protecting rhinos ensures the survival of many other species that share their habitat, including people.<br /><br /> All five living rhino species (Black, White, Indian, Sumatran and Javan) are in terrible peril - from poaching, from forest loss and habitat conversion, and from human settlements encroaching on their habitats in Africa, Indonesia, and India. IRF works to protect particularly threatened rhino populations and their habitats in the wild, while also supporting management of and research on captive populations to improve the chances for long-term survival. IRF operates in situ programs in Asia and Africa targeted to the rhino species most in need of and most appropriate for intensive protection and management. These anti-poaching and protection programs also provide significant benefits for numerous other threatened species and for the entire ecosystems in which the animals live. In all our field programs, we work closely with local communities to ensure that those people living in closest proximity to rhinos, many of whom are also struggling as a result of poverty and environmental degradation, will serve as active partners in wildlife protection and will reap direct benefits from conservation efforts.<br /><br /> IRF&rsquo;s current major programs include: 1) Indonesia Rhino Protection Units, anti-poaching patrol units which protect Sumatran and Javan rhinos in the wild; 2) the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, a research and breeding center for Sumatran rhinos in Way Kambas National Park; 3) the Javan Rhino Study and Conservation Area, a program to expand the only viable habitat for Javan rhinos in the world by 4,000 hectares; 4) Indian Rhino Vision 2020, a program aimed at increasing the number of Indian rhinos and spreading the population out over more protected areas; 5) Zimbabwe Lowveld Rhino Conservation Program, which provides management, monitoring and veterinary interventions for black rhinos in Zimbabwe; and 6) Operation Stop Poaching Now, a campaign to provide training and equipment to anti-poaching units in Zimbabwe and South Africa. IRF also supports scientific research, regularly providing grants for work that is directly applicable to management, propagation and conservation of rhinoceros species in nature and in captivity.</p>','',4,0,0,'@RhinosIRF','International Rhino Foundation','2013-06-14 20:56:36','2013-06-21 14:54:12',0,'international-rhino-foundation'),(171,'Womp For the Kids','New York','New York','NY',10010,'http://womp4thekids.com/','','<p><strong style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #f3f3f3; color: #1c1c1c; font-family: Georgia, serif; line-height: 18px;\">In a combined effort with our charity partners, it is our mission to inspire electronic music fans to support programs that directly improve the health, well-being and education of children.</strong></p>','<p><span style=\"color: #7c7b7a; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">For every purchase, a child in need recieves a life changing gift.

In 1999 I was saved from the Kosovo war and brought to America as a refugee at age 14. <br /><br /> I was only a kid living what I thought to be a normal life until one day everything changed. Lives were lost, homes destroyed, and childhoods stolen. <br /><br /> Imagine going to bed at night wondering if you are going to live to see tomorrow? Hard to picture, right? That was life for me until one day I was saved by people I&rsquo;ve never met before. With the help of truly good people from different charitable organizations, I got a second chance at life and made a promise to make it worthwhile!<br /><br /> <a href=\"http://www.compleopartners.com/images/fort-dix-article.pdf\">Click here to read an article from my first 2 weeks in America</a><br /><br /> <strong>T-shirts? Why T-shirts?</strong><br /><br /> Back in 2012 while working for Morgan Stanley I knew I was ready to jump ship and start a company that would help make the world a better place, I just did not know what I was going to do yet. Explaining my passion and vision to my friend Greg Berry, an executive in the custom apparel industry, he said he would love to give back in some way also and we set up a meeting to talk again.<br /><br /> When we met he had an idea that can change the world. When he said T-shirts, my reaction was &ldquo;T-shirts? Why T-shirts?&rdquo;...<br /><br /> T-shirts! How many t-shirts do you own? How many t-shirts are being worn right now in this building? Everybody has multiple T-shirts and will be getting more this year, what better vehicle to touch millions of lives? I was a bit taken back but my viewpoint on custom t-shirts changed dramatically that day. He was right, the product is omnipresent and the market is ripe for disruption!<br /><br /> As we all use the same blank shirts, same ink, and same print techniques, we can offer customers a win-win situation by allowing them to save money &amp; help others at the same time. <br /><br /> <strong>Ok, I\'m in...</strong><br /><br /> Greg brought previous successes, suppliers, vendors, an established print shop, and expertise and I brought with me a burning desire to make good on my promise from 1999; make my second chance at life worthwhile and provide the same opportunity to as many people as I could. <br /><br /> <strong> What do we name the company?</strong><br /><br /> After several failed attempts at a company name, we finally sat down and determined that we wanted a company that can last forever and a name that would act as a star in the sky assuring that although we may get lost at points, we always know what direction we&rsquo;re heading.<br /><br /> OneBillionShirts.org signifies the massive scale of this concept and industry while also reminding us that we cannot do it alone. A .org is meant for collaboration and we understand that we cannot print 1 billion shirts per year. Just as McDonald&rsquo;s set the bar with The Dollar Menu, we want to turn this industry into a way to redirect wealth to those that need it most, industrywide. <br /><br /> If every shirt printed has a portion of the proceeds directed to charity this simple shift will have a huge effect on the world, which is why we all need to work together to successfully implement this change.<br /><br /> <strong>What\'s Next?</strong><br /><br /> Within months of inception we already worked with some of the top businesses, individuals, and charities in the Boston area and will soon be expanding nationwide. One day very soon the bar will be set and I will be able to proudly look back and although I will never remember each person individually that helped my family and I, I&rsquo;ll be able to say that I repaid my debt to them and made good on my promise to make my second chance at life worthwhile!<br /><br /> Cheers,<br /><br /> <img src=\"http://compleopartners.com/images/Albion-Signature.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /> Albion Calaj, co-founder</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<center><!--abt_sto_txt ends--> <!--abt_sto_txt ends--></center></div>\r\n<!--img_det_txt ends-->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!--<div class=\"btn_align\">-->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!--<div class=\"choose_btn_2\">-->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!--<a href=\"/charities\">Choose Your Charity</a></div>-->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!--</div>--></div>','2013-03-25 15:05:10','2013-05-22 18:24:27'),(5,'top_ten_reasons','<div class=\"slider_hold\" style=\"height: auto;\">\r\n<div class=\"slider_text\">\r\n<h1 style=\"font-size: 46px; width: 700px;\">Top 10 reasons to work with us.</h1>\r\n<p>Our mission is much larger than t-shirts!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<!--slider_text ends--></div>\r\n<!--slider_hold ends-->\r\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"img_det_txt\">\r\n<div class=\"abt_list m_top_75\">\r\n<h1>10.
